## Overview 

In these hands-on exercises, we will be using the Incident Management Application, which is designed as a reference application for the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/btp-developers-guide). It showcases best practices for developing applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

- ⚠️ **Note:** To keep this page open, right-click each link and choose **"Open link in new tab"**.

### Business Scenario
ACME, a leading electronics company, uses this application to manage customer service incidents. The application supports the following business process:
  1. A customer contacts ACME's call center with an issue.
  2. A call center representative (processor) receives the call.
  3. The representative creates a new incident in the system based on the customer's complaint.
  4. The conversation details are recorded as part of the incident.

  </p>

## Step 3: Configure Users access
This section details how to manage users and their access rights within your SAP BTP trial landscape, leveraging SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication Service - IAS) as your identity provider.

### 3.1. Import Business Users into SAP Cloud Identity.
  1. Download user data file [IAS-business-users.csv](./IAS-business-users.csv)
  2. Open your web browser and navigate to your IAS tenant's administration console. The URL typically looks like https://<your_tenant_id>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin.
  3. Enter your administrator credentials and log in.
  2. From the main Dashboard, click on the User Management tile.
  3. Click the **Browse** button to select the CSV file you prepared earlier.
  4. Click the Import button at the top right.
  5. Browse and select your IAS-business-users.csv file.
  7. Click Import.
  8. Click Confirm to finalize the import.

### 3.2. Set initial Password for Business users

## Step 5: Launch SAP BAS, Import Project, and Deploy to Cloud Foundry
### Oveview
In this step, you will use SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) to import, build, and deploy the Secure Incident Management application to your Cloud Foundry environment on SAP BTP.

SAP Business Application Studio is a modern, cloud-based development environment designed for building and extending SAP applications. It provides preconfigured dev spaces that include all required tools, runtimes, and extensions for full-stack cloud application development.

During this step, you will:

* Create a dedicated BAS dev space for the application.
* Import the provided project archive into BAS.
* Build and deploy the application to Cloud Foundry using either the BAS UI or the command line.
* Ensure the application is accessible by assigning the required user role collections.

By the end of this step, the Secure Incident Management application will be successfully deployed on SAP BTP Cloud Foundry, and authorized users will be able to access and use it.

### Step 5.1 Create a Dev Space:

1. Open SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) from your BTP Cockpit.

    * Navigate to **Services > Instances and Subscriptions**.
    * Find **SAP Business Application Studio** under the **Subscriptions** tab and click the **Go to Application** icon.

  <b></b>
</p>

4. The import is complete only when the project folder appears in the Project Explorer and its structure (such as mta.yaml) is fully loaded.








































4- To demonstrate real-world access control, you'll test the application using dedicated accounts with **precisely scoped** role collections. Unlike your **xp260-0xx@education.cloud.sap** training account's broad privileges, these users showcase how proper role assignments enforce **least privilege** in production:
  - **bob.support@company.com** (Support user)
  - **alice.support@company.com** (Support user)
  - **david.admin@company.com** (Admin user)
  - Check the user role collections in the SAP BTP cockpit for **Bob, Alice, and David**
  - Select a user. In the right frame, check the role collections assigned:
      - Check if **bob.support@company.com** and **alice.support@company.com** are assigned to the role collection **Incident Management Support**. 
      - Check if **david.admin@company.com** is assigned to the role collection **Incident Management Admin**.

 <p align="center">
