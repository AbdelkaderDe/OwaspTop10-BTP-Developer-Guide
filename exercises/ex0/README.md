## Overview 

In these hands-on exercises, we will be using the Incident Management Application, which is designed as a reference application for the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/btp-developers-guide). It showcases best practices for developing applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

- ⚠️ **Note:** To keep this page open, right-click each link and choose **"Open link in new tab"**.

### Business Scenario
ACME, a leading electronics company, uses this application to manage customer service incidents. The application supports the following business process:
  1. A customer contacts ACME's call center with an issue.
  2. A call center representative (processor) receives the call.
  3. The representative creates a new incident in the system based on the customer's complaint.
  4. The conversation details are recorded as part of the incident.

### Solution Diagram
The solution diagram illustrates the key components and their interactions within the Incident Management Application deployed on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

## Step 2: Set Up Subscriptions

In this step, you will ensure the necessary applications are subscribed to.

| Application                           | Subscription Plan             | Purpose             |
| :------------------------------       | :--------------- | :---------------    |
| [SAP HANA Cloud](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/serviceCatalog/sap-hana-cloud/?region=all)              | tools             |Provides the database administration tools.|
| [Cloud Identity Services](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/business-application-studio/?region=all)       | default |Manages user authentication|
| [SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/?region=all) | standard         |The Launchpad where you will access your deployed app.|


  ⚠️ **Note:** 
  - Your Trial account comes pre-configured with [SAP Business Application Studio](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/business-application-studio/?region=all) (subscribed) and the
    [Cloud Foundry Environment](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/serviceCatalog/cloud-foundry-runtime?region=all) (enabled). You do not need to add these manually.
  - Before subscribing to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, you must establish trust between your BTP subaccount and an SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication (IAS) tenant using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

### 2.1. Subscribe to SAP HANA Cloud (Trial)
  1. From your Trial Subaccount (Cockpit), look at the navigation menu on the left.
  2. Click on **Service Marketplace**.
  3. Search for **"SAP HANA Cloud"** and select it from the results.
  4. Click the three-dot menu **(...)** next to the service name, then choose Create.
  5. In the Create Subscription wizard:
      * Confirm Service is set to "SAP HANA Cloud"
      * Select **Subscription Plan: tools** (free Trial plan)
      * Click **Create**.
  6. After subscription complete, Confirm **Status = "Subscribed"**

### 2.2. Subscribe to Cloud Identity Services (Trial)
Trial accounts have a pre-linked Identity Authentication (IAS) tenant, so subscription and instance setup are simplified:
  1. Return to the **Service Marketplace** in your subaccount.
  2. Search for **"Cloud Identity Services"** and select it from the results.
  3. Click the three-dot menu **(...)** next to the service name, then choose Create.
  4. In the Create Subscription wizard:
      * Confirm Service is set to **"Cloud Identity Services"**
      * Select **Subscription Plan: default**.
      * Click **Create** to initiate the subscription.
  5. After subscription complete, Confirm **Status = "Subscribed"**
  6. Activate your IAS Administration Console access via email:
      * Check your registered email inbox (including spam/junk folders) for an activation message from SAP Cloud Identity Services.
      * Click the activation link in the email, follow the prompts to set a secure password, and log into the Identity Authentication Administration Console to confirm access. This step is optional for Trial trust setup but required for advanced user management later, including adding business users to access your SAP Build Work Zone and deployed applications.

    <b></b>
  </p>

### 2.3. Establish Trust with SAP Cloud Identity (Trial)
Establishing trust allows SAP Cloud Identity Services to act as your central identity provider, enabling secure Single Sign-On (SSO) and centralized management of business users. This connection is a technical requirement for services like SAP Build Work Zone to authenticate users and correctly assign the role collections needed to access applications.

  1. **Navigate to Trust Configuration:** In your BTP subaccount, go to **Security > Trust Configuration**.
  2. **Initiate Trust Setup:** Click the **Establish Trust** button.
  3. **Choose Tenant:** In the wizard, select your pre-linked SAP Cloud Identity tenant and click **Next**.
  4. **Complete and Review:** Follow the remaining steps for **"Configure Main Information"** and **"Configure Identiy provider and Parameters"**, keep the default values in all steps and click on next, then click **Finish** to activate the trust.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="images/IAS-trust configuration.png" alt="" width="900"/>
    <br>
    <b></b>
  </p>

### 2.4. Subscribe to SAP Build Work Zone, Standard Edition (Trial)
  1. Return to the **Service Marketplace** in your subaccount.
  2. Search for **"SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition"** and select it.
  3. Click the three-dot menu **(...)** next to the service name, then choose **Create**.
  4. In the Create Subscription wizard:
      * Confirm Service is set to "SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition"
      * Select **Subscription Plan: standard**
  5. After subscription complete, Confirm **Status = "Subscribed"**

- Access your SAP BTP account for the session XP260 using this link: [Global Account: SAP-TechEd-2025 – Account Explorer](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit?idp=akihlqzx8.accounts.ondemand.com#/globalaccount/4c772782-0751-42ee-93c3-897452fdcb63/accountModel&//?section=HierarchySection&view=TreeTableView).

- ⚠️ **Note:** You will use an SAP BTP subaccount with subaccount admin privileges. We use the Identity Authentication service tenant **akihlqzx8.accounts.ondemand.com** as custom identity provider, both for platform and application users.

- Login to open your subaccount **XP260_0XX**, where **XX** is your seat number: 
  - Username: **xp260-0XX@education.cloud.sap** ( with XX depending on your seat from 01 - 40 )
  - Password: Will be given to you as part of the session.
  - In the list of directories and subaccounts, click on the entry for your subaccount.

- Check the subscriptions, instances, and the environment under subaccount **XP260_0xx > Instances and Subscriptions** in the **SAP BTP cockpit**.
 
  <p align="center">
    <img src="images/btp-subaccount-instances-subscriptions.png" alt="" width="900"/>

  </p>

### Review the Configured User Access:

- ⚠️ **Note:** In this workshop, your account **xp260-0xx@education.cloud.sap** fulfills two key roles: as a **platform administrator** for configuring role collections and infrastructure, and as a **business application user** for developing and testing secure Incident Management features. This duality simplifies the training environment by eliminating constant re-logins during exercises, but in real-world systems, strict role separation ensuring users hold only necessary permissions—is essential.

1- Check the users under **Security > Users**.

2- Check your user **xp260-0XX@education.cloud.sap**. There will be two representations in the cockpit, one as **platform user** and one as **business user**. 

3- Check **Role Collections** for the Business User
  - Locate and click on the business user representation in the user management interface.
  - Open the Role Collection Details in the right frame.
  - Confirm the Following Role Collections Are Assigned :
      - **Business_Application_Studio_Administrator**
      - **Business_Application_Studio_Developer**
      - **Business_Application_Studio_Extension_Deployer**
      - **Launchpad_Admin**
      - **Subaccount Viewer**

  <p align="center">
    <img src="images/btp-configured_user_platform.png" alt="" width="900"/>
    <br>
    <b></b>
  </p>

4- To demonstrate real-world access control, you'll test the application using dedicated accounts with **precisely scoped** role collections. Unlike your **xp260-0xx@education.cloud.sap** training account's broad privileges, these users showcase how proper role assignments enforce **least privilege** in production:
  - **bob.support@company.com** (Support user)
  - **alice.support@company.com** (Support user)
  - **david.admin@company.com** (Admin user)
  - Check the user role collections in the SAP BTP cockpit for **Bob, Alice, and David**
  - Select a user. In the right frame, check the role collections assigned:
      - Check if **bob.support@company.com** and **alice.support@company.com** are assigned to the role collection **Incident Management Support**. 
      - Check if **david.admin@company.com** is assigned to the role collection **Incident Management Admin**.

 <p align="center">
    <img src="images/btp-configured_user_application.png" alt="" width="900"/>
    <br>
    <b></b>
  </p>

## Review the Development Environment
 
1- As we are using Cloud Foundry, check under **Cloud Foundry > Org Members**, if your platform user **xp260-0XX@education.cloud.sap** has **Org Manager, Org User** under **Org Roles**. 

 <p align="center">
    <img src="images/btp-subaccount-org-members.png" alt="" width="900"/>
    <br>
    <b></b>
  </p>

2- Under **Cloud Foundry > Spaces**, verify the existence of your space called **'XP260-0XX'**.
  
 <p align="center">
    <img src="images/btp-subaccount-space.png" alt="" width="900"/>
    <br>
    <b></b>
  </p>

3- Under Space **XP260-0XX > Space Members**, verify if your platform user **xp260-0XX@education.cloud.sap** has **Space Developer, Space Manager** under **Space Roles**.

 <p align="center">
    <img src="images/btp-subaccount-space-members.png" alt="" width="900"/>
    <br>
